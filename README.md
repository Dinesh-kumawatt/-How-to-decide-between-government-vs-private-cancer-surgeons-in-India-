Choosing between the public and private sector often depends on factors like cost, access, care quality, and personal preferences 
Dr. Singhal offers this practical checklist:

Waiting times: Government hospitals have longer queues; private clinics like his offer faster consults and surgery scheduling.

Surgeon availability: Private care ensures continuity and time with senior surgeons, whereas government setups rely more on trainees and rotating staff.

Technology access: Private centers often use robotic systems, HIPEC, advanced imaging tools—sometimes unavailable in public hospitals.

Personalized attention: Private clinics emphasize dedicated follow‑up, rehab, diet counseling, and psychological support often lacking elsewhere.

Cost transparency: Though pricier upfront, private care may reduce hidden costs (repeat tests, transfers, infections), and streamlined care can save time and stress.
The advice: match the choice with your cancer stage, financial situation, urgency, and trust needs. His clinic welcomes patients regardless of origin.
